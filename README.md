## Objective & Purpose
The objective of this project is to give a brief introduction to Dask and how to use it to speed up point to polygon spatial join. The purpose is to learn how to take advantage of modules that can run the code in parallel to deal with large-scal data. 

## How to run it locally
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Build the enviroment by following the instructions in the **environmental.yml** file.
3. Open the **index.ipynb** and run the code. 
## How to run it remotely
Click the badge below. This badge will bring you to the virtual enviroment boosted through the BinderHub and you can run the code in the **index.ipynb**.
